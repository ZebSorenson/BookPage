       <h1>Consider this your final destination for all of my book reviews </h1>
    
    <p>I have decided to stop using GoodReads! They were stealing money from me and I believe I can make a website that is better than theirs!</p>
    <p>Here you will find all of my book reviews and you can even purchase the books I review.</p>
    <p>If you don't have time to constantely visit my website, sign up for my weekly newsletter</p>
