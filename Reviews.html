       <p>Educated: Tara Westover </p>
       <p>The craziest thing about this book is that these events took place not long ago. It was fascinating to see Tara's journey of growth and develop her own ideas and beliefs. 
       </p>
       <p>Rather than follow the grain of her family before her. I really admire what Tara was able to accomplish.</p>

       <p>Meditations: Marcus Aurelius </p>
       
       <p>I try to stay away from self help books because most of them are trash. However, it does help that the author of this one has been dead for quite some time and isn't motivated by likes on social media.<p/>
        <p>I actually wouldn't call this a self help book. You get to take a personal look into Marcus Aurelius' struggles, beliefs, routines and values.</p>
        <p>The Gregory Hays translation is very digestible</p>

       <p>A Feast for Crows: George R.R. Martin </p>
       
       <p>Very weak compared to A Storm of Swords, but I'll give it more credit than most. You get to see Cersei descend into madness, see Brienne be the new hero of the series and question whether you actually hate Jaime or not. </p>
       <p>Definitely a bit too long and dry sometimes but some fantastic story telling</p>

       <p>A Dance with Dragons: George R.R. Martin </p>
       
        <p>Maybe my rating is lower because I went in with high expectations, but I can't deny it, I expected so much more.</p>
        <p>Nothing happens except for the last few hundred pages. George has written himself into a corner and I'm eager to see how he gets out of it if we ever get the next books.</p>

       <p>Can't Hurt Me: David Goggins</p>
       
        <p>Again, I don't like self help books and I think the parts of this book (specifically the challenges he gives) fall victim to the self help sin of being vague in advice.</p>
        <p>However, when you look at this as the story of David Goggins, it's incredible what humans are capable of. Both physically and mentally and how we are able to change into something completely different. Goggins digs very deep into the idea of how far we can go</p>

       <p>The Stranger: Albert Camus</p>
       
        <p>This was my "read on my kindle until I fall asleep" book</p>
        <p>Very short dark humor with clever writing about how I think a lot of people feel about everyday life. I enjoyed it!</p>

       <p>Brave New World: Aldous Huxley</p>
       
        <p>I went in with high expectations because of all the hype surrounding this book. The story was kind of hard to follow (maybe I'm just dumb)</p>
        <p>but I found it to be just alright. Some good passages and thankfully not too long.</p>

       <p>Children of Time: Adrian Tchaikovsky</p>
       
        <p>This can be a fun read. It quickly caught my attention in the beginning, lost it in the middle and slightly regained it at the end.</p>
        <p>Didn't leave me wanting to read the second but I had a good time!</p>

       <p>The Emperor's Soul: Brandon Sanderson</p>
       
        <p>This is a great intro if you're wanting to get into Brandon Sanderson's books but don't want to dive into the deep end. Explores an interesting type of magic that kept me invested in the story.</p>
        <p>Quick engaging read. 3 stars because there is an aspect of the ending that I didn't love. Definitely recommend!</p>

       <p>Life of Pi: Yann Martel</p>
       
        <p>We were assigned to read this my senior year of high school but I never got around to it. I can see why english teachers love it, there's many opportunities to ask, "wHAt DOeS tHiS REalLy MEaN??"</p>
        <p>It's even filled with a bunch of philosophical questions at the back to ask the inattentive teenagers.

        However, I did devour this book in two days and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a unique story and Pi is a captivating narrator. Even after watching the movie many years ago I was eager to read what would happen next.</p>

        <p>In the end, you see the bright and the dark side of humanity. You want to feel horror after reading what Pi witnessed but end with encouragement after reading about Pi's views on God(s).</p>
        
        <p>A good read!</p>
